# homebridge-http-webhooks
A http plugin with support of webhooks for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

The plugin gets its states from any system that is calling the url to trigger a state change.

Currently supports contact, motion, occupancy, and smoke sensors and switches.

# Installation
1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-http-webhooks`
3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json snippet below.

# Retrieve state
To retireve the current state you need to call the url `http://yourHomebridgeServerIp:webhook_port/?accessoryId=theAccessoryIdToTrigger`
The returned JSON format is:
```
    {
        success: true,
        state: cachedState
    }
```

# Trigger change
To trigger a change of an accessory you need to call the url `http://yourHomebridgeServerIp:webhook_port/?accessoryId=theAccessoryIdToTrigger&state=NEWSTATE`

## Contact sensor
For contact sensors the value for `NEWSTATE` is either `true` for contact or `false` for no contact.

## Motion sensor
For motion sensors the value for `NEWSTATE` is either `true` for motion detection or `false` for no motion.

## Occupancy sensor
For occupancy sensors the value for `NEWSTATE` is either `true` for occupancy detection or 'false' for no occupancy.

## Smoke sensor
For smoke sensors the value for `NEWSTATE` is either `true` for smoke detection or `false` for no smoke.

## Switch
For switches the value for `NEWSTATE` is either `true` for on or `false` for off.

# Trigger action

## Switch
For switches you can trigger a url of any system for switching the switch on or off.
